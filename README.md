The backbone of our vehicle tracking system is its server-side logic that processes data. Using Spring Boot, we'll create a simple REST API that handles vehicle registration and provides vehicle location data.

Set up a Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr.
Create a basic REST controller to handle HTTP requests.
Implement endpoints for vehicle registration and fetching vehicle data.
Test your endpoints using Postman or any other API testing tool.
